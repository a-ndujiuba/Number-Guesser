# Number-Guesser
Python code which utilises a binary search algorithm to guess a random number between 1 and 1000. 
This project was an introduction to the creation of a binary search. I was able to see that the maximum number of guesses for the programme to guess a value between a low and high number is equal to log of the high number to the base 2.

The programme asks the user to think of a number between a LOW and HIGH value, assigned as 1 and 1000 respectively in this case. The user presses 'l' if the computer need to guess lower, 'h' if a higher guess is required and 'c' if the guess was correct. This is encapsulated in a while loop, with 'c' breaking out of the loop, and printing the number of guesses required to obtain the value the user originally thought of.
